# VibeHotel — legal starter (clean-room)

This is a **minimal, original** starter project for a Habbo-like *social isometric room* game.
It uses **no ripped assets** and avoids copying any specific UI/layout. Everything is drawn with code.

## What you get
- Web client (Vite + TypeScript + PixiJS)
- Node server (TypeScript + WebSocket)
- One simple isometric room (tile grid)
- Multiplayer presence: users join/leave, click-to-move, chat

## Requirements
- Node.js 18+ (recommended 20+)
- npm

## Run (dev)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Client: http://localhost:5173
- Server: ws://localhost:8080

Open the client in **two browser tabs** to test multiplayer.

## Next steps (safe + legal)
- Keep all art original (commission your own pixel art, or use CC0 assets).
- Make the UI your own (layout, icons, typography).
- Add auth, inventory, furniture placement, moderation, persistence.
